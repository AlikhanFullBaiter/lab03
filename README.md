# MyLinkedListQueue🧩
This is a Java implementation of a queue data structure using a ***LinkedList***.

# Overview 👨‍💻
A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

This implementation uses a ***LinkedList*** to store the elements of the queue. Elements are added to the back of the queue using the ***enqueue*** method, and removed from the front using the ***dequeue*** method. The ***peek*** method returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
