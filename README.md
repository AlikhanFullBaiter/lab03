# MyLinkedListQueueüß©
This is a Java implementation of a queue data structure using a ***LinkedList***.

# Overview üë®‚Äçüíª
A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

This implementation uses a ***LinkedList*** to store the elements of the queue. Elements are added to the back of the queue using the ***enqueue*** method, and removed from the front using the ***dequeue*** method. The ***peek*** method returns the front element of the queue without removing it.

# Functionality ü¶æ
The public methods available in this implementation are:

***enqueue(E element)***: adds the specified 
element to the back of the queue.

***dequeue()***: removes and returns the front element of the queue.

***peek()***: returns the front element of the queue without removing it.

***checkList()***: returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

***size()***: returns the number of elements in the queue.

# Usage üöÄ
To use this implementation, create an instance of MyLinkedListQueue and start adding elements:
```bash
MyLinkedListQueue<String> list = new MyLinkedListQueue<>();
list.enqueue("element 1");
list.enqueue("element 2");
list.enqueue("element 3");
```
You can then remove elements from the queue using the dequeue method:
```bash
String element = list.dequeue(); // returns "element 1"
```

You can also use the peek method to get the front element of the queue without removing it:
```bash
String front = queue.peek(); // returns "element 2"
```
To check if the queue is empty, use the checkList method:
```bash
boolean empty = queue.checkList(); // returns false
```
And to get the number of elements in the queue, use the size method:
```bash
int size = queue.size(); // returns 2
```

# MyLinkedListStack  üß©
This is a simple implementation of a stack using a linked list in Java. The stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack will be the first one removed.
